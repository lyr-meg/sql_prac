-- where and when rides take place, charge customers, and pay drivers the right amount.
-- To do this, we collect latitude and longitude coordinates from the GPS on the driverâ€™s
-- phone every few seconds for the duration of the ride, then use a pricing table to determine a final route and cost.

-- ride_locations
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | ride_id | varchar | - ride that location data is part of
-- | ts | float | - time in seconds since 1/1/1970 ..
-- | lat | float | - latitudinal coordinate
-- | lng | float | - longitudinal coordinate
-- +---------------+---------+

-- Use the following as the rate card to pay drivers (prices are in USD)
-- 'costPerMile': 1.35
-- 'costPerMinute': 0.27
-- 'costMinimum': 5
-- 'pickupCharge': 2.25

-- Q1. Which ride_id took the most amount of time?

select ride_id,
ROUND((MAX(ts) - MIN(ts)) / 60, 2) as duration
from ride_locations
group by ride_id
order by duration desc
limit 1;

-- Q2. Assuming that the GPS information is perfectly accurate, how would you accurately calculate the price we should pay to the driver for each ride
-- simple formula that calculates the price we should pay to the driver for each ride: (costPerMile * distance) + (costPerMinute * duration) + costMinimum + pickupCharge
-- very simple formula to calculate Mile using lat and lng: sqrt((lat2 - lat1)^2 + (lng2 - lng1)^2) * 69
